## Exercise

[Exercise for next time:](/BSIM_exercise.pdf)

In [BSim](http://www.behaviorbasedprogramming.net/), design a simulation according to the diagram in the. Choose behaviors and parameters to make
the robot (circle) find and move to the light source and stop there.

*Hint: start simple and refine the simulation gradually.*

You may add further complexity by adding hockey-pucks and having the robot avoid them.
